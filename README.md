To initiate a boss fight, give yourself a warden's mark with either '/trigger f_marker_trigger set 13' or 'function foppy:give_mark", and fire it at the target. If you want to turn into a warden yourself, use '/tag @s add warden_mark'.
Marked players will initiate a transform sequence upon death and gain their stats and abilities.
